This system is used for the early detection of stunting in toddlers with age calculation from date time by RTC and birthdate from LCD input, callable data from SD Card (so once the toddlers even add data to system, they will not add any important data second times such as birthdate, address, parent's name, parent's phone, etc), and stunting calculation using Standard Data from World Health Organization (WHO).

This system using some of component below: 

1. TFT ILI9488 3.5" Touchscreen
2. Ultrasonic Sensor HY-SRF05
3. Voltage Sensor
4. ESP32 Devkit V1
5. SD Card and   SD Card Module
6. RTC Module
7. Battery Sony VTC6


nb: I can't share the "TBU.h", "BBU.h", "BBTB.h", and "IMTU.h" file because those files contain important data from WHO
